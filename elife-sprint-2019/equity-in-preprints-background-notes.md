# Preprint visibility background notes

About: Place for notes about idea to improve access of authors to literature contributions & peer review, help readers find otherwise low visibility content (before it has cause to be low visibility). Initial proposal written out for eLife Sprint 2019 application: [here](https://github.com/npscience/transparent-opportunities/blob/master/events/elife-sprint-2019.md) and copied below in italics.

Status: ongoing

## Topline

Science is not a meritocracy: peer review (by a journal or otherwise) is not inherently equitable (in fact, it is just as subject to bias as other social judgment processes) and preprints are also subject to the Matthew effect (the rich get richer). Preprints present a lower barrier to sharing work but are not sufficient to improve equity in how science is rewarded (visibility, curation, reputation, funding). For preprints to improve equity in science, an intentional effort is required to ensure fair attention is paid to preprints by authors whose science is not already seen or rewarded by the journal publishing process.

## Context
Preprints undergo basic screening checks before being posted online. Anyone can post a preprint (except where eligibility requirements are applied by preprint server e.g. at arXiv, at Open Research platforms); once posted, it is available for anyone to read online.

Preprints are posted before formal peer review. Processes are emerging to review, filter and curate preprints: the aim is that good science, interesting ideas, useful and reusable methods, should filter to the top -- the science is seen beyond the non-expert, the authors are rewarded for their contributions. Peer review is valuable both in terms of improving work (bringing it up to standard by sharing best practices / requesting improvements) and providing validation on already good-enough work, before it enters the 'body of scientific knowledge' (which continues to be validated & updated over time).

When anyone can post content on the web, social processes that review, curate and filter content that is deemed to be accurate and reliable are important: without these, inaccurate, unreliable content may gain attention and influence society. Terry Pratchett predicted fake news would be spread on the internet without some form of hierarchy of reputation based on expertise (https://inews.co.uk/news/terry-pratchett-fake-news-internet-prediction-bill-gates/) and he was right.

However, reputation hierarchies and review processes are inherently social in nature, and are thus subject to the same biases as other social processes:
* we pay attention to those we know, we trust information from those we have understood to be reliable before;
* we don't typically seek out those we don't know or have connection/commonality with in order to broaden the network we each trust (who has time for this?);
* we make judgements based on what we know already about people we know -- previous performance as the best indicator of future performance -- hence why we resort to author names to prejudge quality of work and whether it's worth us reading more;
* we have internalised geopolitical biases -- you don't need to be explicitly racist or sexist to bring implicit biases to situations of social judgement; these biases are reinforced by structural inequalities;
* curation and filtering decisions that contribute to social elevation tend to be made by people with higher social status, and people with higher social status are more likely to represent people with lower burden of bias and inequality.

Scientific peer review is imperfect and can propagate bias and inequalities:

Preprints offer a route for people to share scientific work after a lower level of gatekeeping than formal peer review. This means more people may be able to share their work online and more quickly.

However, preprints are simply a tool for sharing content online. Science is not a meritocracy, and preprints are subject to the same social biases as any other process of visibility, filtering and curation.

Preprint discovery is currently dominated by twitter: the larger your twitter following, the more reach your content has and the more influence you exert. It follows that preprints authored by people who are well-connected on twitter are more likely to be seen, read, reviewed and so on. Indeed, some initiatives direct attention towards preprints that have already gained attention on twitter, thus perpetuating any visibility bias, which cannot be assumed to be due to the quality of the content (rxivist.org, twitter.com/PromPreprints). *Note also that twitter is not a community-owned infrastructure and may not be a reliable method for alerting the community to new content in the long-term.*

Beyond twitter: without the fallback of a journal brand attached to a new manuscript, readers report deciding whether to read new work based on whether they know the authors (e.g. last author, lab name). Note also that not all scientists are on twitter or feel comfortable using it: some researchers prefer to use platforms they deem to be more profiessional, such as linkedin, researchgate, academia.edu.

Therefore, preprints present a lower barrier to sharing work but are not sufficient to improve equity in how science is rewarded (visibility, curation, reputation, funding).

Actually, the act of posting a preprint may be currently biased towards people who are traditionally more secure in their jobs: US authors (first and last) are over-represented in authorship of journal articles that were previously deposited to biorxiv (nov 2013-Dec 2017) while female authors are under-represented: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673665v1.full

How to break beyond the twitter bubble? Other discovery mechanisms for preprints:
* sign up for alerts, feeds, direct from server & from third-party tools
e.g. PLOS monthly email, PreLights & PreLists, rxivist (trending preprints), twitter bots (@PromPreprints = promising preprints according to early social attention; SBotLite = RTs female first author preprints from biorxiv)
third-party infrastructure design decisions:
* work with specific preprint servers (e.g. bioRxiv, which is largest atm --> platform dominance)


Opportunities:
(1) discovery of preprints beyond twitter network
(2) identify preprints by authors who are less visible in traditional Global North publishing venues --> top of the pile for review, filtering?
(3) identify preprints regardless of where posted? (so long as posted somewhere with ethical screening, archiving, withdrawal processes?)


# Focus on opportunity 2
**How might readers identify new preprints by authors (first author?) who may be less likely to be seen and prioritise them for reading & review? The reader would then add weight to the preprint with a peer recommendation and/or provide feedback as to how they can improve, thus providing the first step towards full scientific review and reputation gain. This isn't a one-stop solution that makes science meritocratic, instead it's a helping hand towards improving access to reputation by those under-served in the current process.**
